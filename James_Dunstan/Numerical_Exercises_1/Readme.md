Please find a hand-written PDF file which goes through the mathematical parts of the questions (questions are numbered according to the handout). These handwritten 
notes are also referenced in the other 'Jupyter Notebook' file. The Jupyter Notebook file includes the code I wrote to implement the various numerical schemes. When 
opened in Jupyter notebook (accessible through anaconda/appsanywhere) please click run ~ run all cells and this should generate the plots needed to answer the questions.
The code itself also contains comments to explain what I'm doing.
